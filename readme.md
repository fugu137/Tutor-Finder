# Tutor Finder Application #

*Tutor Finder is a web application built using Spring Boot, Javascript, and CSS. The application allows users to store and load information about tutors via their web browser.*

## Running Tutor Finder ##
To run the application:
1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Run `Application.java` at `\src\main\java\com\example\spring\` to start the server.
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to use the application. Tutors can be added by clicking the icon at the top right of the screen.\*

*Note: this is a work in progress and still a basic version of the appliction. At this point, the filter buttons don't affect which tutors are shown, and the load button isn't functional. These features will be implemented shortly once an SQL database is added to the application.
